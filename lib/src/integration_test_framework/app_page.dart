/// The [AppPage] is a fundamental component of the integration test framework.
/// An [AppPage] represents a logical "screen" in the app; a visual representation
/// of the app's current state. [AppPages] provide convenient methods to perform all
/// the functionality that the user can perform on the particular screen.
///
/// [AppPage]s do not need to necessarily mirror widgets in the codebase exactly.
/// A screen may be composed of many widgets and some widgets have several functionality
/// modes. The appropriate scope for an [AppPage] is what the user can do when the app
/// is in a particular state.
///
/// For example, suppose the app is currently logged out. What can the user do?
/// "what screen does the user see?" In this case the user is looking at the Login screen.
/// The only things that the user can do on the Login screen is to login or transition
/// the app's state to the new user registration screen. Therefore, we might add a
/// [AppPage] called "LoginPage". the "LoginPage" would have a login method which
/// takes a username and password. It would also have a "registerNewUser" function
/// which performs a transition to another page we might call "RegistrationPage" and
/// the function should return and instance of the "RegistrationPage".
///
/// The main point of this distinction is to provide a consistent and intuitive API
/// for our integration tests by organizing the thousands of things our apps can do
/// into classes which represent the screens in which each of those functions are
/// applicable. Testing becomes much easier this way.
